    ## and negative errors equally, i.e. we say that it is equally
    ## wrong to overestimate accuracy as it is to underestimate. This
    ## simplifies the calculations. Consider the following example, if
    ## the accuracy of model A is 0.7 in the development sample and
    ## the true accuracy in the validation sample is 0.6. Then the
    ## error is 0.1. If the accuracy in the segmented sample is 0.75
    ## then the error of this approach is -.05. When we are
    ## calculating the difference in error we get -0.15, which is not
    ## what we want, because we can see that the difference in error
    ## is really 0.05. One easy solution is then to work with absolute
    ## differences. Hope this makes sense.

# Introduction
In medicine, healthcare professionals are daily confronted with a wide range of information that needs to be processed in order to make informed clinical decisions. To help healthcare professionals make such informed decisions, prediction models (also referred to as prediction score or prediction rules) have been implemented in healthcare [@steyerberg2013prognosis] [@moons2009prognosis]. These prediction models can be defined as statistical algorithms that predict the risk of a specific outcome in an individual [@moons2009prognosis] [@collins2015transparent]. The prediction models are capable of this task due to being trained in finding patterns in predictor data that has been labeled with outcome. These patterns can then be used in order to predict outcome based on new unlabeled predictor data [@deo2015machine].

The risk that is predicted by the prediction models is generally based on multiple predictors and the outcome could either be a disease (diagnostic model) or an event that will occur in the future (prognostic model) [@collins2015transparent] [@riley2013prognosis]. In the diagnostic model, the predicted risk can be used to reassure the patient that their symptoms are not caused by a serious disease, refer the patient to further testing or to initiate treatment [@collins2015transparent]. A great example of a diagnostic model is the Ottawa Ankle Rules. This prediction model helps healthcare professionals by predicting the risk of a fracture in the ankle or the foot, in patients with acute ankle injuries. To predict this risk, the prediction model utilizes predictor data such as bone tenderness at different locations and the inability to bear weight on the injured foot immediately after injury and in the emergency department (ED). Based on the predicted risk, the healthcare professionals can decide whether the patient is in need of x-ray imaging [@shell1993decision].

In the prognostic model, the predicted risk can be used to choose between therapeutic options, plan lifestyle changes and to risk-stratify patients in therapeutic clinical trials [@moons2009prognosis] [@steyerberg2009practical] [@dorresteijn2011estimating] [@hayward2006multivariable]. A great example of a prognostic model is the CHA2DS2-VASc score. This prediction model helps healthcare professionals by predicting the annual risk of developing an ischemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. To predict this risk, the prediction model utilizes predictor data such as history for congestive heart failure, hypertension, age >74, diabetes, stroke/transiet ischemic attack/thromboembolism, vascular disease, age 65-74 and female sex [@lip2010refining]. Based on the predicted risk, the healthcare professionals can decide whether the patient is in need for anticoagulation treatment [@kirchhof20162016].

There are many uses for prediction models within the fields of medicine, where the Ottawa Ankle Rules and the CHA2DS-VASc score are just a few examples that have been implemented in clinical practice. In order to develop and implement such useful models within healthcare, a few steps are needed to be carried out. These steps include model development studies, model validation studies and model impact studies [@royston2009prognosis] [@moons2012risk].

In the first step consisting of the model development study, the aim is to develop a prediction model [@royston2009prognosis]. The prediction model is developed by selecting a statistical algorithm and a development sample. There are a couple of algorithms to choose from, but usually when the development sample is limited, a simpler algorithm is utilized such as logistic regression [@deo2015machine]. The development sample consists of relevant outcome labeled predictor data, which is used to train the algorithm in finding patterns between the outcomes and the predictors [@deo2015machine] [@royston2009prognosis]. When the algorithm has been trained, it usually tends to be optimistic in its predictive performance when predicting outcome in the development sample [@steyerberg2003internal]. It is therefore important to quantify such optimism through internal validation techniques [@steyerberg2009practical]. The quantified optimism can thereafter be adjusted for by applying shrinkage or penalization to the model [@steyerberg2001application].

In the second step consisting of the model validation study, the aim is to assess the predictive performance of the prediction model within a validation sample. The validation sample consists of new individuals, with outcome labeled predictor data, that differ in various ways from the individuals in the development sample. These individuals may differ in the time in which their data were collected (temporal validation) or from which country or hospital their data were collected (geographical validation). Geographical validation assesses how well the prediction model performs when the model is transferred from one hospital/country to another. Such external validation is important, due to internally validated prediction models tendency to perform worse in new sets of individuals. If the performance is poor within the validation sample, the model is of no value [@moons2012risk].

In the third and final step consisting of the model impact study, the aim is to assess the prediction models impact, ideally in a randomized trial. The impact of the model is assessed in variables such as decision making changes in healthcare professionals, patient health outcomes and/or cost-effectiveness of care. These impact studies are carried out to prove that the prediction model is of value in clinical practice [@moons2012risk].

Carrying out these prediction model studies can be complex as problems may arise during the time in which they are carried out. One such problem may occur during the model validation studies. In these studies, in order to obtain the predictive performance of the prediction model within the validation sample, available predictor and outcome data is required from the validation sample [@moons2012risk]. This data is not always available retrospectively and can present a problem that is both time inefficient and expensive, if the data is difficult to access when collecting it prospectively. 

This specific problem would present itself if data for the Framingham Risk Score were to be collected prospectively, in order to perform a model validation study. The predictor data in this prediction model are cheap blood samples and simple demographics while the outcome data is cardiovascular disease within 10 years [@anderson1991cardiovascular]. The predictor data for this prediction model may be easily accessible but the outcome data is only accessible after 10 years of follow up. Due to the difficulties in collecting the outcome data prospectively, this specific problem would be presented.

It would therefore be desirable to have a method that can predict the predictive performance of a prediction model, after it has been transferred, by only utilizing unlabeled predictor data from the validation sample. Such a method could in theory, simplify the process of implementing prediction models in clinical practice and therefore indirectly improve decision making changes in healthcare professionals, patient health outcomes and/or cost-effectiveness of care. At present, no such studies nor methods exists which presents a substantial knowledge gap. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop and test a new method for predicting prediction model performance after transfer utilizing unlabeled data.

# Aim
The aim of this study was to develop and test a new method for predicting prediction model performance after transfer utilizing unlabeled data. 

# Methods and Materials
## Study design
The study design was an analytical registry based study. To perform the analysis, a dataset was used that has been made freely reusable by the multinational observational study by Eckert A et al in the Dryad Digital Repository [@eckart2019combination] (18). This dataset was chosen due to consisting of patient data from different countries with available patient parameters that can be linked to a patient outcome.

## Participants
The participants enrolled in the dataset were all patients seeking ED care between March 2013 and October 2014 within three tertiary care centers in the USA (Clearwater Hospital), France (H척spital de la Salp챗tri챔re) and Switzerland (Kontonsspital Aaura). The data that was registered for each participant included the hospital and the country in which the patient seeked ED care, vital signs, laboratory assessments, age, discharge location, length of stay, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death within 30 days. The inclusion criteria to be enrolled in the dataset was that an initial blood sample was taken. The exclusion criteria were pediatric or surgical patient [@eckart2019combination].

## Variables
### Model predictors
The model predictors that were used from the dataset, in order to develop prediction models and simulate new model predictors in the statistical analysis, included respiratory rate (per min), peripheral oxygen saturation (%), systolic blood pressure (mm Hg), heart rate (bpm), temperature (째C) and age. These variables were selected due to being continuous. How these variables were measured was not mentioned in the study that publicized them.

### Model outcomes
The model outcomes that were used from the dataset, in order to to develop prediction models and simulate new model outcomes in the statistical analysis included ICU admission and the country from which the patient seeked ED care. ICU admission was chosen as the outcome for the prediction model due being more frequent than death within 30 days.

### Sample size
The final sample size used in this study was 1303 participants which included all of the participants from the dataset.

### Missing data
Because of the dataset already being filtered to mostly containing no missing data, a complete case analysis was carried out.

## Statistical analysis
### Dataset
The dataset previously mentioned in the study design was divided based on the country from which the participants seeked ED care (USA sample, France sample and Switzerland sample).

### Sequence of analysis
Analysis in this study was performed in the programming language R (19). The cutoff level for all of the prediction models were set to 0.5. The sequence of analysis performed were sample simulation, sample assignment, prediction model development, development sample accuracy, validation sample accuracy, propensity model development, predicted validation sample accuracy and approach comparison. 

### Sample simulation
To increase the number of participants in the samples, 10000 new participants were simulated for each of the divided samples. The process of simulation included a model predictor simulation and a model outcome simulation. The model predictors that were used to simulate new model predictors included respiratory rate, peripheral oxygen saturation, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, temperature and age from the divided samples. The model outcomes that was used to simulate new model outcomes included ICU admission from the divided samples.

To simulate new model predictors for one of the divided samples, the mvrnorm function implemented in the MASS package was used (20). The function utilized the mean and the covariance of the model predictors in the divided sample to simulate new model predictors. To simulate new model outcomes for the simulated model predictors, the glm function implemented in R was used to develop a logistic regression model (21). This model was trained with the model predictors and model outcomes from the divided sample. The model was then used to predict outcome based on the simulated model predictors. These predictions were set as the outcomes for the simulated model predictors in order to create simulated samples. The model predictor and model outcome simulation were performed for each of the divided samples until three simulated samples were developed.

### Sample assignment
To simulate the transfer of a prediction model from one country to another, one of the simulated samples was noted as the development sample while one of the two remaining simulated samples was noted as the validation sample. The development sample represented data from the country in which the prediction model was created, while the validation sample represented data from the country in which the prediction model was transferred to.

### Prediction model development
In the prediction model development step, a prediction model was developed by training a logistic regression model with the development sample. To adjust for optimism, cross-validation to chose the simplest model within one standard error from the best model. The cross-validation technique was based on a 80% training and 20% testing split of the development sample with five folds. The model predictors that were used to train the model included respiratory rate, peripheral oxygen saturation, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, temperature and age. The model outcome that was used to train the model included ICU admission.

### Development sample accuracy
To assess the predictive performance of the prediction model within the country that it was developed in, the model developed in the prediction model development step was used to predict outcome within the development sample. The predictions where then compared with the true outcomes in the development sample in order to acquire the accuracy of the model within the development sample.

### Validation sample accuracy
To assess the predictive performance of the prediction model within the country to which it was transferred to, the model developed in the prediction model development step was used to predict outcome within the validation sample. The predictions where then compared with the true outcomes in the validation sample in order to acquire the accuracy of the model within the validation sample.

### Propensity model development
In the propensity model development step, the data from the development sample and the validation sample were pooled into one sample. This aggregated sample was then used to develop a propensity model, also a prediction model, using logistic regression. The propensity model was then used to predict from which sample the data in the aggregated sample originated from. Observations from the development sample that were missclassified as validation observations, were used to create a segmented sample. The model predictors that were used to train the propensity model included respiratory rate, peripheral oxygen saturation, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, temperature and age. The model outcome that was used to train the propensity model was the country in which the participant seeked ED care.

### Predicted validation sample accuracy
To assess the predicted predictive performance of the prediction model within the country it was transferred to, the model developed in the prediction model development step was used to predict outcome within the segmented sample created in the propensity model development step. The predictions where then compared with the true outcomes in the segmented sample in order acquire the predicted validation sample accuracy.

### Approach comparison
To assess the errors in the "naive approach", the absolute difference between the accuracies acquired in the development sample accuracy step and the validation sample accuracy step were calculated. To assess the error in the "segmented approach", the absolute difference between the accuracies acquired in the predicted validation sample accuracy step and the validation sample accuracy step were calculated. To assess which approach performed best, the difference between the naive approaches and the segmented approaches were calculated.

### Sequence repetition
To obtain 95% confidence intervals (CI) around the accuracies and the differences, the sequence of analysis will be repeated 1000 times. These repetitions were performed for each available combination in the sample assignment step.

## Ethical considerations
### Principle of autonomy
The dataset that was used in this study has been made freely reusable in Dryad Digital Repository (18). Therefore, the principle of autonomy is upheld due to there not being any requirement for informed consent.

### Principle of beneficence
This study attempted to act in the best interest of future analytical research and patients, by developing and testing a new method for predicting prediction model performance after transfer utilizing unlabeled data. Such a method could in theory, simplify the process of implementing prediction models in clinical practice and therefore indirectly improve decision making changes in healthcare professionals, patient health outcomes and/or cost-effectiveness of care.

### Principle of nonmaleficence
The method developed in this study will be made without the intention of harm, intentionally or unintentionally. To nullify the risk of patient identification leakage, we used a dataset that has already been depersonalized and made freely reusable. By taking these actions we determined that the risk to the population was minimal.

### Principle of justice
Due to this study being analytical, the principle of justice does not prevail. However, the data in the study was treated equally.

### Ethical permit
No ethical permit was required because this study used a public database.
